import smtplib

# Set up email server
server = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587)
server.starttls()
server.login('your_email@gmail.com', 'your_password')

# Set up email content
subject = 'Doughnut Shop Promotion'
body = 'Come visit our new doughnut shop!'
message = f'Subject: {subject}\n\n{body}'

# Set up list of users
users = ['user1@example.com', 'user2@example.com', 'user3@example.com']

# Send email to each user
for user in users:
    server.sendmail('your_email@gmail.com', user, message)

# Close email server
server.quit()

This code uses the smtplib library to send an email to each user in the users list. You will need to replace your_email@gmail.com and your_password with your own Gmail address and password.

from twilio.rest import Client

# Set up Twilio client
account_sid = 'your_account_sid'
auth_token = '
